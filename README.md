Getting Started
---------------
*[This site uses github pages, and pubnub to allow webrtc, and DNS servers. 
  Create a new account with pub nub, they will give you a free use for their servers.
  Keep in mind this is not ideal for 24/7 use of the webcam because there is a certain amount of usage 
  you get per month for the webcam.

*[After you have created a account, create a github io page. The page has to be the same
  name as your username, and is not https. So it is not protected, 'DO NOT PUT SENSITIVE INFORMATION'

0. Add a couple notifications, or events, maybe even a youtube embed.

copy paste the embed code to loop the video, and change the seemingly
random letters and numbers in the playlist area. 
You can save to a .csv file for your notifications, or load from a 
preexisting file. The load doesn't have to be from a .csv file, it can
