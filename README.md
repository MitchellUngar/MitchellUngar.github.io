# Getting Started

This site uses github pages, and pubnub to allow webrtc, and DNS servers. 
Create a new account with pub nub, they will give you a free use for their servers.
Keep in mind this is not ideal for 24/7 use of the webcam because there is a certain amount of usage 
you get per month for the webcam.

# Using the Site
# Editing
First you have to go to http://mitchellungar.github.io
Second sign in using your privledges.
After that you can now do the edits that you want to do.
Add a couple notifications, or events, maybe even a youtube embed.
If you want the video to loop the rel=0 code is already there, just 
copy paste the embed code to loop the video, and change the seemingly
random letters and numbers in the playlist area. 
You can save to a .csv file for your notifications, or load from a 
preexisting file. The load doesn't have to be from a .csv file, it can
be a text file from notepad. 
Submit and move to the next page.
